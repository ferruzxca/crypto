        </header>
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies have represented a bold new frontier in the world of finance. Whether you have been a risk-taker looking to strike digital gold or just someone intrigued by the future of money, there's no denying that the world of crypto is as exciting as it has been unpredictable. So, saddle up and enjoy the ride, partner!</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2>What Are Cryptocurrencies?</h2>
            <p>Imagine if you have carried a wallet full of money that didn't weigh you down or need to be stored in a bank. Cryptocurrencies are exactly that—digital or virtual currencies secured by cryptography, which has made them nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Bitcoin, the pioneer and poster child of cryptocurrencies, was created in 2009 by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, thousands of different cryptocurrencies have burst onto the scene.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Big Names</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin (BTC): The granddaddy of them all. With a market cap that has often exceeded the GDP of small countries, Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. Think of it as the digital gold standard.</p>
            <p>Ethereum (ETH): More than just a currency, Ethereum has been a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts—applications that have run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, fraud, or interference.</p>
            <p>Ripple (XRP): Designed for seamless global payments, Ripple has focused more on being a bridge between traditional financial institutions and blockchain technology.</p>
            <p>Dogecoin (DOGE): What has started as a joke—a cryptocurrency based on the popular "Doge" meme—has become a major player in the market, thanks in part to enthusiastic support from celebrities like Elon Musk.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>How Do They Work?</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies have operated on a technology called blockchain. A blockchain has been a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. This decentralization has meant no single entity has control, which has been one reason why crypto enthusiasts are so passionate about them.</p>
            <h3>The Process</h3>
            <p>Here's a quick rundown of the process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Transaction Initiation: You have wanted to send some Bitcoin to your friend. You initiated a transaction.</li>
                <li>Broadcast to Network: The transaction has been broadcast to a network of computers (nodes).</li>
                <li>Validation: These nodes have validated the transaction using consensus mechanisms like proof of work (mining) or proof of stake.</li>
                <li>Recording: Once validated, the transaction has been added to a block, which has then been added to the blockchain.</li>
                <li>Completion: Your friend has received the Bitcoin!</li>
            </ol>
